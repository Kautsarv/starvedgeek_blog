Hello my name is Kautsar Virzawan, currently living in Jakarta and working as a Sofware Quality Assurance Engineer, i create this blog only for my own journal to help me remember about things that i learned from my working experience as software tester, because i love everything about culinary, i think it would be good for me or maybe someone if i put my culinary review in this blog. IT stuff and food culinary, sounds like a weird combination, but why not :D
